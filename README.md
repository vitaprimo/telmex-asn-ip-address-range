# telmex-asn-ip-address-range

List of the IP ranges for Mexico's biggest ISP's AS numbers:
ASN8151, AS28550

These are meant to be used in firewall rules on firewalls that may use
these lists but don't have enough resources to download the data and parse
to create the lists on their own, e.g; cheap cloud gateway servers.

It's possible this list grows to covers other regional IP ranges.
